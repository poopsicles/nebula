# Working with logic

## Logical statements
Up to this point, you have done everything you possibly can - reading and writing text, and have learned quite a lot of the math capabilities of Python.

From now on, you will be learning logic. You won’t learn complex theories that academics love to study but just the simple basic logic that makes real programs work and that real programmers need every day.

Learning logic has to come after you do some memorization. I want you to do this exercise for an entire week. Even if you are bored out of your mind, keep doing it. This exercise has a set of logic tables you must memorize to make it easier for you to do the later exercises.

At first, this won’t be fun. It will be downright boring and tedious, but this is to teach you a very important skill you will need as a programmer. You will need to be able to memorize important concepts in your life. Most of these concepts will be exciting once you get them. You will struggle with them, like wrestling a squid, then one day, \*snap\** you will understand it. All that work memorizing the basics pays off later.

Do not try to sit down for two hours straight and memorize these tables. This won’t work. Your brain will really only retain whatever you studied in the first 15 or 30 minutes anyway. Instead, what you should do is create a bunch of index cards with each column on the left on one side (True or False) and the column on the right on the back. You should then pull them out, see the “True or False,” and be able to immediately say “True!”.

Keep practicing until you can do this.

Once you can do that, start writing out your own truth tables each night into a notebook. Do not just copy them. Try to do them from memory, and when you get stuck, glance quickly at the ones I have here to refresh your memory. Doing this will train your brain to remember the whole table.

Try not to spend more than one week on this, because you will be applying it as you go.

## The Truth Terms

In Python (and computing, in general) we have the following terms for determining if something is “True” or “False.” Logic on a computer is all about seeing if some combination of these characters and some variables is True at that point in the program.

> and

> or

> not

> != (not equal)

> == (equals)

> \>= (greater-than-or-equals)

> <= (less-than-or-equals)

> True

> False
