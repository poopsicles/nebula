# Nebula

A simple [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) introduction course, with some [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) thrown in for *good* measure.

This product was created with the use of ~~child~~ (well technically, since none of the participants are legal "children" anymore -- except, *ahem*, me, it's more of...) manual labour.

Well the point is, we were *coerced* (well we had good intentions but those faded away once we saw the sheer magnitude of the thing) into doing the thing with exams ongoing and with only a week to like, do the thing so yeah...enjoy!

It was originally going to be a [Qt for Python](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/) application, then it became a [Binder notebook](https://jupyter.org/binder), and then some of us knew Rust...so we settled on [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

The important thing is that it...works, right?

## Stop! No more! How can I experience this wonder?

- If you just want to see it, and see the course for yourself, then [https://poopsicles.github.io/nebula/](https://poopsicles.github.io/nebula/) shall suffice quite nicely.

- If you're incredibly bored, or perhaps want to make some changes, clone the repository, install mdBook, and [serve/build](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/cli/index.html) the thing.
